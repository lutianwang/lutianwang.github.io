Hello! This is Chuhan Li. I'm an undergraduate in Boston University major in [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) and [Statistics](https://www.bu.edu/stat/). I'm interested in machine learning, deep learning, statistical machine learning, approximation algorithm, and randomized algorithm. What's more, I'm a bird-watcher, wildlife photographer, and the member of [MassAudubon](https://www.massaudubon.org). In addition, I plan to be a YouTuber this summer sharing my thoughts and ideas about first-order logic, elementray proof techniques, elementray discrete math, randomized algorithm, and machine learning. 


Undergraduate @BU
======
I'm currenly a senior student in Boston University. I am fortunate to have [Prof. Evimaria Terzi](http://cs-people.bu.edu/evimaria/) as my advisor. Also, I'm a member of [BU Data Science Association (BUDSA)](https://www.budatasci.com/about). My current interests are algorithmic data mining and transformer neural networks, and I'm dedicated myself to solve real world problems like [Amazon review analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurav9786/amazon-product-reviews) and [COVID-19 chest X-ray analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database).



Birding
======
My first bird-watching experience was in [Mai Po](https://www.wwf.org.hk/en/wetlands/mai-po/), Hong Kong, China with WWF when I was in my seventh grade. Then I spend two years oberserving and banding migrating birds in Sun Yat-sen University when I was in my eighth and ninth grade.  In summer 2021, I spent two months in Aba, Sichuan, China oberserving and photographing birds. I've seen more than 800 birds in China. In winter 2020, I was the member of the winer team in the international bird-watching competition in Shangri-La. In the United States, I've been to Boston and Miami for bird-watching and wildlife photography.
